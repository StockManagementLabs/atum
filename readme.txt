The ultimate stock management plugin for serious WooCommerce Sellers.

== Description ==

ATUM is an advanced stock management plugin for WooCommerce. It is a must for every serious shop owner. The free version gives you a complete control of all your products from one page. Beautifully carved into the WordPress interface, the system feels familiar and very user-friendly.  

The plugin comes from Stock Management Labs, creators that have combined over 25 years of experience in inventory management. The team is working very closely with professional developers towards creating the complete product that will take care of all business needs.

While preparing for the development stage, the team has tested and tried several inventory management products and plugins. We can now say with full confidence that the complete ATUM product will be unrivalled in every category.
