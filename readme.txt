== Frequently Asked Questions ==

ATUM inventory management plugin is completely free and will stay as such. It was designed to suit most users that need essential inventory control of their business.

= How do I preview and monitor products in the Stock Central screen? =

In Stock Central screen, you can sort your products into two lists, the 'controlled' and 'uncontrolled' list. Products you would like to monitor, control or edit you will see in the default controlled list that shows 'immediately' after you open the Stock Central screen. Products you do not wish to monitor you can find in the 'uncontrolled' list. Move products from one list to another is quick and straightforward and can be done directly on the Stock Central screen.

= Can I quickly change the stock amount for individual products? =

Yes, click the stock amount of the relevant product under the "Current Stock" column. ATUM opens a little pop-up, where you can apply your change. Now you can do many changes at the same time and hit the save button that appears on the top left.
