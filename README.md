The ultimate stock management plugin for serious WooCommerce Sellers.

## Description

ATUM is an advanced stock management plugin for WooCommerce. It is a must for every serious shop owner. The plugin gives you a complete overview of all your products from one page. Beautifully carved into the WordPress interface, the system feels very familiar and user-friendly.  

ATUM stock manager for WooCommerce comes from Stock Management Labs™, creators that have combined over 25 years of experience in inventory management.

**Once Activated**

Open the stock central menu and follow the message at the top of the page or activate the stock control from the `Settings > Stock Central` menu. You will not see any items in the Stock Central view unless you enable the "Manage Stock" functionality at the product level. ATUM will enable the complete stock management for you. The plugin will remember your original settings in case you decide to deactivate the plugin later. ATUM will ask you if you'd like to return to your original setting at this stage.

* We have prepared the Stock Central help section that will guide every user through the individual column functionality. 
* Our team has prepared the preview of confirmed features that will be available in out Premium and PRO version. You can find these by opening any of the inactive menu pages.
