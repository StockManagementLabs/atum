## Description

ATUM is an advanced inventory management plugin for WooCommerce. It is a must for every serious shop owner. The plugin gives you a complete overview of all your products from one page. Beautifully carved into the WordPress interface, the system feels very familiar and user-friendly.

ATUM comes from Stock Management Labsâ„¢, creators that have combined over 25 years of experience in inventory management. The team is working very closely with a bunch of professional developers since October 2016. The aim is to create the complete product that will take care of all business needs.

In the preparation process for the development stage, we have tested and tried the most popular WooCommerce and cloud inventory management products and plugins in the world. With full confidence, we believe that the complete ATUM product will be unrivalled in every category.

## Installation

**From your WordPress dashboard**

1.  Visit `Plugins > Add New`.
2.  Search for 'ATUM Stock Manager for WooCommerce'.
3.  Activate ATUM from your Plugins page.
 
**From WordPress.org**

1.  Download ATUM.
2.  Upload the 'atum' directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, using your favorite method (FTP, SFTP, SCP, etc).
3.  Activate ATUM from your Plugins page.

**Once Activated**

Open the ATUM Inventory menu and follow the message at the top of the page or activate the stock control from the `ATUM Inventory > Settings > Stock Central` tab. You will not see any items in the Stock Central view unless you enable the "Manage Stock" functionality at the product level. ATUM will enable the complete stock management for you. The plugin will remember your original settings in case you decide to deactivate the plugin later. ATUM will ask you if you'd like to return to your original setting at this stage.

If you'd like to see only selected products, leave the ATUM stock control option disabled. You will need to enable/disable the stock control of each product from their product listing page (Inventory Tab).

**Once Configured**

* ATUM was designed to give the user overall control of the full WooCommerce inventory from one screen. Stock Central can be completely configured, and individual columns that are not part of the free version disabled.
* We have prepared the Stock Central help section that will guide every user through the individual column functionality.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### What are the minimum ATUM requirements?

ATUM requires PHP version 5.6 or greater, but our recommended environment is the same as WordPress:
